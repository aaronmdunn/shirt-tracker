# Release Notes — 1.939.3

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Add new..." dropdown option doing nothing in the Tauri desktop app. The root cause was window.prompt() being silently blocked by WKWebView on macOS, returning null and reverting the dropdown. Both prompt() call sites (Add new dropdown option and tab rename) have been replaced with a custom HTML dialog that works consistently across desktop web, mobile web, and Tauri.
- Fixed ghost bordered cells appearing next to every row in the Actions column on desktop web and Tauri. The actions td element had display:flex applied directly, which broke it out of the table-cell layout and caused the browser to generate an anonymous empty table cell. The flex layout was moved to an inner wrapper div so the td retains its natural display:table-cell behavior.

## Custom Prompt Dialog

- Added a reusable text-prompt-dialog element that replaces all window.prompt() usage across the app. The dialog uses the same dialog-body, dialog-row, and dialog-actions structure as existing dialogs for visual consistency.
- The showTextPrompt(title, label, defaultValue) function returns a Promise that resolves to the entered string or null on cancel. Supports Enter to save and Esc to cancel. All event listeners are cleaned up after each use to prevent leaks.
- The "Add new..." dropdown dialog dynamically shows the column name in its title (e.g. "Add New Type", "Add New Fandom").
- The tab rename dialog pre-fills the current tab name for editing.

## Tauri Desktop App

- Added Import CSV to the File menu alongside the existing Export CSV (renamed from "Share Data (CSV)"). Both menu items trigger the same exportCsv() and importCsv() functions as the buttons in the Cloud Backup section.
- The File menu now shows: Export CSV, Import CSV, Event Log.

## UI / UX

- Changed photo preview thumbnail background from black (#111111) to white (#ffffff) on both desktop and mobile web.
- Changed the scroll hint arrow from "Scroll ->" to "Scroll →" using a proper Unicode right arrow on desktop web.

## Credits

- Added Retro Rifle (retro-rifle.com) to the Featured Brands list in the Credits & Acknowledgements dialog on both desktop and mobile web.
