# Shirt Tracker v1.936.0 — Release Summary

## Highlights
- Desktop app menu refinements, including Event Log wiring and Last Deployment tied to Tauri build time.
- Tauri sync/build workflow improvements to keep HTML, assets, and fonts aligned.
- Privacy/credits/content parity across desktop, mobile, web-root, and Tauri.
- Auth/loading polish and public share usability fixes (including mobile button sizing).
- Netlify routing, share, and build consistency improvements across /d and /m.

## Details
- **Header actions layout:** Desktop and mobile header actions now use JS-driven inline layout (no CSS grid dependency), improving stability across devices.
- **Routing:** Redirect logic for /d and /m is more reliable, including a UA guard; SPA fallbacks preserved.
- **Share mode:** Choose Columns hidden in share mode; share flows and deployment date handling improved.
- **Photo dialog:** Display issues corrected for consistent presentation.
- **Filters:** Reset filter bug fixed.
- **Auth UX:** Signed-out UI hidden during auth checks; Loading placeholder shown near sign-in.
- **Fresh defaults:** Added fresh user defaults and `?fresh=1` reset support.
- **Desktop menu:** Removed Attributes item; File -> Event Log now opens the Event Log dialog.
- **Deployment stamp:** Desktop “Last Deployment” now reflects Tauri build time (sync script stamps it).
- **Tauri sync:** Added `scripts/sync-tauri-html.mjs` and `npm run sync:tauri` to sync HTML/assets/fonts/manifest/steve.png.
- **Tauri build helper:** Added `scripts/build-tauri.sh` to sync, build, and open the app.
- **Assets/fonts:** Fixed missing Tauri assets/fonts by syncing and skipping /d,/m redirect logic inside Tauri builds.
- **Versioning:** Bumped to 1.936.0 across web desktop, web mobile, Tauri HTML, and `tauri.conf.json`.
- **Privacy dialog:** Content now consistent across all five index outputs (desktop web, mobile web, desktop Tauri, web-root/d, web-root/m).
- **Cleanup:** Removed duplicate web-root outputs (`d 2`, `m 2`, `_redirects 2`).
- **Contact form:** Netlify form submit no longer 404s by posting to `/d/` or `/m/` instead of `/`.
- **Privacy scroll:** Privacy dialog always opens scrolled to the top.
- **Mobile sizing:** Copy Share Link button sizing syncs reliably on first load (ResizeObserver + font-ready pass).
- **Credits order:** Icon attributions moved to the bottom and added “Fonts sourced from dafont.com”.
