# Release Notes — 2.0.2

## Icon Picker

- Replaced the icon picker dropdown with a visual 4-column grid of clickable tiles showing the actual icon images alongside their labels, making it much easier to browse and select the right icon
- Renamed labels for clarity: "Performance Hoodie" (was "Hoodie") and "Misc" (was "Miscellaneous")

## Per-Tab Column Hiding

- Added a Hide/Show toggle button for each column in the Edit Columns panel, allowing users to hide columns on a per-tab basis without removing them from the column list entirely
- Hidden column preferences are stored in the columnOverrides object as hiddenColumnsByTab and persist across sessions
- Hidden columns are excluded from the table header, data rows, and filter dropdowns via a new getVisibleColumns() function
- Fixed cloud sync to restore hiddenColumnsByTab from the backup payload — previously only fandomOptionsByTab and typeOptionsByTab were being extracted, so hidden column preferences were lost when syncing to a new device

## Drag-and-Drop Column Reordering

- Replaced the up/down arrow buttons in Edit Columns with a grip handle (≡) that supports full drag-and-drop reordering via both mouse and touch events
- Touch drag uses passive: false on touchmove listeners with e.preventDefault() to prevent page scrolling while dragging

## Photo Dialog

- Fixed image clipping in the photo preview dialog caused by align-items: center on a flex container with overflow: hidden — the image was being centered by its midpoint and then clipped symmetrically from top and bottom
- Changed the container to align-items: stretch with margin: auto on the image and flex: 1 1 0 so the image scales within the available space without clipping

## Filter Bar

- Moved the Tags filter from the second position to the end of the filter dropdown list, placing it after the more commonly used column filters

## Mobile Edit Columns

- Fixed the Edit Columns panel overflowing off screen on small mobile viewports when many columns are present
- Hidden the options summary column on mobile to save horizontal space
- Reduced button sizes and adjusted the grid layout for compact screens

## Credits

- Added Hales Speed Shop to the featured brands list in Credits & Acknowledgements
- Added Retro Rifle to the legal disclaimer text

## Build Tooling

- Rewrote bump-version.mjs from scratch to accept an explicit version argument, target the correct 5 source files (two app.js, two index.html, tauri.conf.json), verify all 7 version locations after update, and exit with an error if any verification fails
- Changed the pretauri npm script from auto-bumping the version on every Tauri build to running sync:tauri instead, making version bumps a deliberate manual step

## Housekeeping

- Added CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md with a comprehensive session context prompt covering project rules, architecture, discoveries, and accomplished work
- Removed CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md from .gitignore so it syncs to the repository
