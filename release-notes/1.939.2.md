# Release Notes — 1.939.2

## Default Columns

- Removed Brand from the default column set for new users; new accounts now start with: Condition, Shirt Name, Size, Type, Fandom, Price, Preview, Notes

## Profile Name Dialog

- Display name skip preference is now persisted to Supabase user_metadata (display_name_skipped) in addition to localStorage, so the prompt no longer re-appears when logging in from a different browser or device
- Added Enter key support to trigger Save via keydown listener on the profile name input
- Added Esc key support to trigger Skip (with full Supabase persistence) via cancel event interception on the dialog

## Icon System

- Icon cells are now clickable — a delegated click listener on sheetBody catches clicks on .icon-cell, reads the data-type attribute, and calls openTypeIconDialog directly, bypassing the queue gate so users can re-pick icons for types that already have a mapping
- Each icon cell stores a data-type attribute with the row's lowercase type value, updated by both renderRows and handleCellEvent
- Icon cells show cursor: pointer when the user has edit permissions (not read-only/viewer)

## Filter Bar

- Added a keyboard shortcut hint next to the Filter label on desktop web, showing "(⌘F to find)" on Mac or "(Ctrl+F to find)" on other platforms, detected via navigator.userAgent
- Hint is visible to all users including share link viewers
- Mobile web has no find bar, so no hint is rendered there

## UI / UX

- Restyled the auth loading indicator with Work Sans font, 0.8rem, weight 600, uppercase, wide letter-spacing, muted color, and a loading-pulse keyframes animation (opacity 0.4 to 1.0 on 1.8s ease-in-out loop)
- Loading text changed from "Loading..." to "LOADING" (the pulse conveys activity without needing an ellipsis)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed share link failing when duplicate rows exist in Supabase: loadPublicShareState replaced .maybeSingle() (which throws PGRST116 on multiple matches) with .order("updated_at", { ascending: false }).limit(1) to always pick the newest row

## Housekeeping

- Removed unused Shirt Tracker Sync.app macOS bundle and deno.lock file, added both patterns to .gitignore
- Created REFACTOR-PROMPT.md with a comprehensive prompt for a future session to split the single-file SPA into separate HTML/CSS/JS source files
- Unified version numbers across all HTML sources, tauri.conf.json, and README.md to 1.939.2 (previously HTML sources used 1.939.002 while tauri.conf.json used 1.939.2)
