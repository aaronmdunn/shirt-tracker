# Release Notes — 2.0.3

## For Sale Feature

- Added a "For Sale" toggle button in the Actions column (inventory mode only) that marks items as for sale by adding a special "For Sale" tag to the row
- When a row is marked for sale, a green "FOR SALE" badge appears below the Shirt Name, visible to both the owner and anyone viewing the shared link
- Added "For Sale" as a filter option in the filter dropdown with Yes/No selection to quickly show only items that are or aren't marked for sale
- The feature uses the existing Tags infrastructure so it syncs to the cloud automatically and can also be filtered via the Tags filter

## Column Sorting

- Clicking any column header now sorts the table by that column in ascending order, clicking again toggles to descending
- A small red arrow indicator appears next to the active sort column's label showing the current direction
- Number columns like Price sort numerically while all other columns sort alphabetically
- Empty values are always pushed to the bottom regardless of sort direction
- Sort state persists across sessions using the existing state.sort infrastructure that was already being serialized but was previously unused

## Price Stats

- Expanded the footer cost display to show both total cost and average price per item
- Desktop shows the stats inline separated by a pipe divider, mobile stacks them vertically

## Mode Switcher Repositioned

- Moved the Inventory/Wishlist segmented toggle from its own full-width centered row into the sheet header bar (desktop and Tauri only), where it sits left-aligned opposite the action buttons
- Reduced the toggle's padding and font size to fit cleanly in the header

## Token Refresh Flicker Fix

- Fixed the UI flicker that occurred when switching browser tabs and returning by skipping the full auth reload cycle when Supabase fires a TOKEN_REFRESHED event

## Account Switching

- Added localStorage isolation when switching between user accounts on the same browser — detects when a different user signs in and clears all cached app data to prevent one account's data from bleeding into another
- Fixed a bug where calling applyGlobalColumns() inside applyCloudPayload() caused one account's column structure to overwrite another's after cloud sync

## Wishlist Fixes

- Fixed inventory tabs leaking into wishlist mode on first switch by clearing tabsState.tabs before loading wishlist data
- Hidden the Tags filter option in wishlist mode since tags are not used there
- Fixed wishlist Brand dropdown options not persisting across page refreshes by loading brandOptionsByTab in initWishlistMode()
- Fixed per-tab dropdown options being lost after async cloud sync by calling the tab option restorer functions inside applyCloudPayload()

## Housekeeping

- Removed the unused steve.png image from all build targets and the Tauri sync script
